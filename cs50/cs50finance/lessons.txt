SQL
use NUMERIC instead of INTEGER for money, need decimal places

# NEED THIS TO CASCADE DELETE! PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;

SELECT * FROM usershares where userID = 7 ORDER BY total; << doesnt work
SELECT * FROM usershares where userID = 7 ORDER BY 'total'; << works, don't use total as column name

HTML
Need "" as in "layout.html" in extend statements.

# session["test"]="teststring"
# <p>{{ session.test }} : session dictionary is accessible without being passed into HTML during render_template</p>
